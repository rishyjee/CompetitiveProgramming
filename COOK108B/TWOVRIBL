Chef played an interesting game yesterday. This game is played with two variables X and Y; initially, X=Y=0. Chef may make an arbitrary number of moves (including zero). In each move, he must perform the following process:

Choose any positive integer P such that P⋅P>Y.
Change X to P.
Add P⋅P to Y.
Unfortunately, Chef has a bad memory and he has forgotten the moves he made. He only remembers the value of X after the game finished; let's denote it by Xf. Can you tell him the maximum possible number of moves he could have made in the game?

    while int(math.sqrt(y))+1<=n:
